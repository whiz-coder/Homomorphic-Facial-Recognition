# Homomorphic-Facial-Recognition
This project demonstrates the implementation of a homomorphic facial recognition system using the Tenseal library and DeepFace. The system enables secure facial recognition by performing calculations on encrypted facial embeddings, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected while conducting facial comparisons.
